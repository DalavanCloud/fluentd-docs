# FAQ

## What version of Ruby does fluentd support?

Fluentd v0.14 works on Ruby 2.1 or later. See LINK(v0.12):[v0.12 document](/articles/faq#what-version-of-ruby-does-fluentd-support) for earlier versions.

### I use Linux distribution which uses Ruby 2.0, how can I use Fluentd?

Ruby 2.0 is not supported by Fluentd v0.14. You can install specified Ruby version using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).

Using td-agent is another way to avoid this problem because td-agent includes own Ruby.

### When will td-agent be released with Fluentd v0.14?

It's not fixed yet. td-agent is the package including stable version of Fluentd, and we're thinking that Fluentd v0.14 is unstable right now.

## Known Issue

## Operations

### I have a weird timestamp value, what happened?

The timestamps of Fluentd and its logger libraries depend on your system's clock. It's highly recommended that you set up NTP on your nodes so that your clocks remain synced with the correct clocks.

### I installed td-agent and want to add custom plugins. How do I do it?

td-agent has own Ruby so you should install gems into td-agent's Ruby, not system Ruby.

#### td-agent 3:

(To be added after release of td-agent 3)

### How can I match (send) an event to multiple outputs?

You can use the `copy` [output plugin](/articles/out_copy) to send the same event to multiple output destinations.

### How can I use environment variables to configure parameters dynamically?

Use `"#{ENV['YOUR_ENV_VARIABLE']}"`. For example,

    :::text
    some_field "#{ENV['FOO_HOME']}"

(Note that it must be double quotes and not single quotes)

### File buffer doesn't work properly, why?

`file` buffer has limitations. Check [`buf_file` article](buf_file#limitation).

## Plugin Development

### How do I develop a custom plugin?

Please refer to the [Plugin Development Guide](http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/plugin-development).

## HOWTOs

### How can I parse `<my complex text log>`?

If you are willing to write Regexp, [fluentd-ui's in_tail editor](/articles/fluentd-ui#intail-setting) or [Fluentular](http://fluentular.herokuapp.com) is a great tool to verify your Regexps.

If you do NOT want to write any Regexp, look at [the Grok parser](https://github.com/kiyoto/fluent-plugin-grok-parser).
