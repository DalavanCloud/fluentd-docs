INCLUDE: _what_is_td_agent

## Step 0: Before Installation

Please follow the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install) to configure your OS properly. This will prevent many unnecessary problems.

## Step 1 : Install from Apt Repository

For Ubuntu, we currently support "Ubuntu 16.04 LTS / Xenial 64bit", "Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / Trusty 64bit".

A shell script is provided to automate the installation process for each version. The shell script registers a new apt repository at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/treasure-data.list` and installs the `td-agent` deb package.

For Xenial,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-xenial-td-agent3.sh | sh

For Trusty,

    :::term
    curl -L https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com/sh/install-ubuntu-trusty-td-agent3.sh | sh

It's HIGHLY recommended that you set up <b>ntpd</b> on the node to prevent invalid timestamps in your logs. Please check the [Preinstallation Guide](before-install).

NOTE: If you need <b>Security Tested Binary</b> with a clear life cycle management, please check the <a href="http://www.fluentd.org/enterprise">Enterprise Offering</a>.

## Step2: Launch Daemon

The `/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status
    td-agent (pid  21678) is running...

The following commands are supported:

    :::term
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
