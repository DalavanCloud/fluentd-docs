# Elasticsearch Output Plugin

The `out_elasticsearch` Output plugin writes records into Elasticsearch. By default, it creates records by bulk write operaion. This means that when you first import records using the plugin, no record is created immediately. The record will be created when the `chunk_keys` condition has been met. To change the output frequency, please specify the `time` in chunk_keys and specify `timekey` value in conf.

NOTE: This document doesn't describe all parameters. If you want to know full features, check the Further Reading section.
