# windows_eventlog Input Plugin

The `in_windows_eventlog` Input plugin allows Fluentd to read events from the Windows Event Log.

## Installation

`in_windows_eventlog` is included in td-agent 3 msi by default. Fluentd gem users will need to install the `fluent-plugin-windows-eventlog` gem using the following command.

    :::term
    $ fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-windows-eventlog

## Example Configuration

    :::text
    <source>
      @type windows_eventlog
      channels application,system,security
      pos_file C:\temp/fluentd-windows-eventlog.pos
      tag winevt.raw
    </source>

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Event example

Here are generated event examples. `in_windows_eventlog` set corresponding channel to `channel` field.

    :::text
    # system
    {"channel":"system","record_number":"40432","time_generated":"2017-03-07 09:15:39 +0000","time_written":"2017-03-07 09:15:39 +0000","event_id":"7036","event_type":"information","event_category":"0","source_name":"Service Control Manager","computer_name":"WIN-7IMHK7EQ5T3","user":"","description":"The Windows Installer service entered the stopped state.\r\n"}
    # security
    {"channel":"security","record_number":"26735","time_generated":"2017-03-07 09:14:43 +0000","time_written":"2017-03-07 09:14:43 +0000","event_id":"4726","event_type":"audit_success","event_category":"13824","source_name":"Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing","computer_name":"WIN-7IMHK7EQ5T3","user":"","description":"A user account was deleted.\r\n\r\nSubject:\r\n\tSecurity ID:\t\tS-1-5-21-1367273608-854253166-2945741587-500\r\n\tAccount Name:\t\tAdministrator\r\n\tAccount Domain:\t\tWIN-7IMHK7EQ5T3\r\n\tLogon ID:\t\t0x39e29\r\n\r\nTarget Account:\r\n\tSecurity ID:\t\tS-1-5-21-1367273608-854253166-2945741587-1004\r\n\tAccount Name:\t\tabc\r\n\tAccount Domain:\t\tWIN-7IMHK7EQ5T3\r\n\r\nAdditional Information:\r\n\tPrivileges\t-\r\n"}

## Parameters

### @type (required)
The value must be `windows_eventlog`.

### tag (required)
The tag of the event.

### channels
The event log channels to read. Multiple channels can be specified, separated by â€˜' or array type

    :::text
    # , separated
    channels application,system,security
    # array
    channels ["application", "system", "security"]

Default is `["application"]`.

### read_interval
The interval of reading windowd event log. Default is `2` seconds.

### pos_file (highly recommended)
This parameter is highly recommended. Fluentd will record the position it last read into this file.

    :::text
    pos_file C:\temp/fluentd-windows-eventlog.pos

NOTE: Don't share pos_file between `in_windows_eventlog` configurations. It causes unexpected behavior, e.g. corrupt pos_file content.

## FAQ

### in_windows_eventlog can't read `setup` or `security` events, why?

You need administrator privilege to read these channels. Launch fluentd/td-agent as an administrator.
